# Discord Logging System Updates

## Overview

This document tracks all changes made to the Discord logging system in the Mulla Backend application. The logging system was completely restructured to provide consistent formatting, immediate delivery, and better organization.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. **Batching System Restructure**

**Before:**
- All Discord logs were batched through `DiscordRateLimiterService`
- Rate limiting applied to all logs (30 requests per minute)
- 5-second batch timeout for all logs

**After:**
- **Immediate delivery** for 37 operational logs
- **Batched delivery only** for 3 business bulk transfer logs
- **Rate limiting completely removed** as requested
- Logs deliver instantly without delay

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Jobs/DiscordBots.php` - Added batching flag parameter
- `app/Traits/Reusables.php` - Split into immediate and batched methods
- `app/Services/DiscordRateLimiterService.php` - Removed rate limiting
- `app/Services/BulkTransferService.php` - Uses batched delivery

### 2. **Log Structure Standardization**

**Before:** Multiple inconsistent patterns
```php
// Pattern 1: Full structure (some logs)
DiscordBots::dispatch(['message' => 'text', 'details' => [...]]);

// Pattern 2: Simple message only (many logs)
DiscordBots::dispatch(['message' => 'simple text']);

// Pattern 3: Trait method calls
$this->sendToDiscord('message');
```

**After:** Single consistent pattern for ALL logs
```php
DiscordBots::dispatch([
    'message' => '📱 **Sentence case bold message**',
    'details' => [
        'field1' => 'value1',
        'field2' => 'value2',
        'timestamp' => now()->toDateTimeString()
    ]
]);
```

### 3. **Message Format Updates**

**Before:**
- Mixed case messages: "USER LOGIN SUCCESS", "Meter validation failed"
- Multiple emojis: "⚡🔴", "🔒✅", "⚠️🚨"
- No bold formatting
- Inconsistent wording

**After:**
- **Sentence case with bold**: "🔒 **User login success**"
- **Single emoji** per message
- **Consistent formatting** across all logs
- **Professional tone** throughout

### 4. **Logs Commented Out**

The following logs were disabled (commented out) to reduce noise:

1. **Daily Summary** (`app/Console/Commands/DailySummaryCommand.php:121-141`)
2. **Push Notifications** (`app/Jobs/PushNotificationJob.php:31-39`)
3. **Customer.io User Identified** (`app/Services/CustomerIoService.php:42-51`)
4. **Customer.io Event Tracked** (`app/Services/CustomerIoService.php:73-83`)

## Current Log Inventory

## Technical Implementation

### **Immediate Logging Flow**
```
Controller/Service → sendToDiscord() → sendToDiscordDirect() → Discord Webhook (immediate)
```

### **Batched Logging Flow** (Bulk Transfers Only)
```
BulkTransferService → sendToDiscordBatched() → DiscordRateLimiterService → ProcessDiscordBatch → Discord Webhook
```

### **Key Files Modified**

1. **Core Logging Files:**
   - `app/Jobs/DiscordBots.php` - Added batching control
   - `app/Traits/Reusables.php` - Split immediate/batched methods
   - `app/Services/DiscordRateLimiterService.php` - Removed rate limiting

2. **Service Files Updated:**
   - `app/Services/BulkTransferService.php` - Updated to full structure, batched
   - `app/Services/VirtualAccount.php` - Updated to full structure
   - `app/Services/CustomerIoService.php` - Updated + commented out
   - `app/Jobs/Jobs.php` - Updated BVN validation logs
   - `app/Jobs/PushNotificationJob.php` - Updated + commented out

3. **Command Files:**
   - `app/Console/Commands/DailySummaryCommand.php` - Updated + commented out

4. **Controller Files:**
   - All controller Discord logs were already in good format
   - `app/Http/Controllers/MullaTransferController.php` - Already updated
   - All other controllers maintained existing structure

## Benefits of Changes

### **Performance Improvements**
- ✅ **37 logs deliver immediately** (no batching delay)
- ✅ **No rate limiting bottlenecks** 
- ✅ **Reduced operational noise** (4 logs disabled)

### **Consistency & Maintenance**
- ✅ **Single standardized format** for all logs
- ✅ **Professional Discord appearance** with bold formatting
- ✅ **Easy to read and search** with consistent structure
- ✅ **Future-proof structure** for adding new logs

### **Operational Benefits**
- ✅ **Real-time alerting** for critical events
- ✅ **Structured data** for all log entries  
- ✅ **Preserved batching** for high-volume bulk operations
- ✅ **Reduced Discord channel noise**

## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```env
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/production-url
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_DEV=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/development-url
```

### **Batching Configuration** (Only for Bulk Transfers)
```php
// config/services.php
'discord' => [
    'rate_limit' => [
        'batch_size' => env('DISCORD_BATCH_SIZE', 10),
        'batch_timeout_seconds' => env('DISCORD_BATCH_TIMEOUT', 5),
    ],
],
```

## Future Considerations

### **Adding New Logs**
When adding new Discord logs, follow this pattern:
```php
DiscordBots::dispatch([
    'message' => '📱 **Brief descriptive message**',
    'details' => [
        'user_id' => $userId,
        'email' => $userEmail,
        'relevant_field' => $value,
        'timestamp' => now()->toDateTimeString()
    ]
]);
```

### **Re-enabling Commented Logs**
To re-enable any commented logs, simply uncomment the `DiscordBots::dispatch()` calls in:
- `app/Console/Commands/DailySummaryCommand.php`
- `app/Jobs/PushNotificationJob.php`  
- `app/Services/CustomerIoService.php`

### **Monitoring**
- Monitor Discord webhook rate limits (2000 requests per 10 minutes)
- Consider log aggregation for high-traffic scenarios
- Regular review of log usefulness and noise levels
