# Production Readiness Testing Checklist

## Phase 2 Improvements - Testing Guide

### 1. SafeHaven Token Management Testing
- [ ] **Token Caching**: Verify tokens are cached for 35 minutes
- [ ] **Token Refresh**: Test automatic token refresh after cache expiry
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test behavior when SafeHaven token endpoint fails
- [ ] **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple simultaneous requests should use same cached token

**Test Command**:
```bash
# Check cache storage
php artisan tinker
>>> Cache::get('safehaven_access_token')
```

### 2. Wallet Concurrency Testing
- [ ] **Multiple Browser Tabs**: Open electricity modal in multiple tabs, attempt simultaneous payments
- [ ] **Insufficient Balance**: Verify only one transaction succeeds when wallet balance is exactly enough for one payment
- [ ] **Race Condition Prevention**: Database locks prevent double spending
- [ ] **Balance Consistency**: Wallet balance remains accurate across all concurrent operations

**Test Scenario**:
1. Set wallet balance to exactly ₦2000
2. Open 3 browser tabs
3. Attempt ₦1500 payment in all tabs simultaneously
4. Only 1 should succeed, others should show insufficient balance

### 3. SafeHaven Status Verification Testing
- [ ] **Success States**: Test handling of 'successful', 'success', 'completed' statuses
- [ ] **Pending States**: Test handling of 'pending', 'processing', 'initiated' statuses  
- [ ] **Failure States**: Test handling of 'failed', 'error', 'declined' statuses
- [ ] **Unknown States**: Test handling of unexpected/null statuses
- [ ] **Missing Token**: Test behavior when status is success but no utilityToken provided

### 4. Provider-Specific Response Mapping Testing
- [ ] **VTPass Response**: Verify correct token extraction from VTPass responses
- [ ] **SafeHaven Response**: Verify correct token extraction from SafeHaven responses
- [ ] **Frontend Handling**: Frontend correctly displays tokens from both providers
- [ ] **Token Formatting**: Both VTPass and SafeHaven tokens display correctly formatted

### 5. End-to-End Fallback Testing
- [ ] **Meter Validation Fallback**: VTPass validation fails → SafeHaven validation succeeds
- [ ] **Payment Fallback**: VTPass payment fails → SafeHaven payment succeeds
- [ ] **Complete Failure**: Both services fail → User refunded properly
- [ ] **Discord Logging**: All scenarios properly logged to Discord
- [ ] **Email Notifications**: Success emails sent for all successful transactions

### 6. Error Recovery Testing
- [ ] **Network Timeouts**: Test behavior when APIs timeout
- [ ] **Invalid Credentials**: Test behavior with wrong API keys
- [ ] **Malformed Responses**: Test handling of unexpected API response formats
- [ ] **Database Failures**: Test behavior when database operations fail
- [ ] **Cache Failures**: Test behavior when Redis/cache is unavailable

### 7. Production Load Testing
- [ ] **High Volume**: Test with multiple simultaneous users
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during peak load
- [ ] **Database Connections**: Ensure connection pool doesn't exhaust
- [ ] **Cache Performance**: Monitor cache hit/miss ratios

## Critical Security Checks
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data moved to .env
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: All user inputs properly validated
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: Frontend properly sanitizes displayed data
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Suspicious activity detection working
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: All transactions logged with full details

## Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] **Response Time**: Payment processing < 30 seconds
- [ ] **Meter Validation**: < 10 seconds for validation
- [ ] **Token Generation**: < 45 seconds end-to-end
- [ ] **Cache Hit Rate**: > 90% for repeated token requests
- [ ] **Database Query Time**: < 100ms for wallet operations

## Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Discord Alerts**: All critical events sending notifications
- [ ] **Database Monitoring**: Query performance tracked
- [ ] **API Monitoring**: External API response times tracked
- [ ] **Error Rates**: Failed transaction rates monitored
- [ ] **User Experience**: Frontend error reporting functional
